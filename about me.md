Hi, My name is Zain and I'm 13 year's old. I just started learning to code ( it's been about 1.5 year's ) and I'm finding it really fun and interesting!

Languages I know:

  -HTML
  -CSS
  -Javascript
  -C++
  -Python
  
What I want to learn in the future:

  -Django
  -React JS
  -Node JS
  -Express JS
  -Bootstrap
  
I also develop game's in Roblox.
I have moved away from Game developing and I want to start to learn App developing.

I hope you have a pleasant day!
